# CareWatchAI-
CareWatch AI is a Snowflake-native AI-for-Good app that helps hospitals and NGOs detect disease spikes, prevent medicine shortages, and check data quality. Users simply ask questions in a Copilot-style chat and get real-time alerts, heat-maps, and one-click reorder lists — all inside Snowflake.
